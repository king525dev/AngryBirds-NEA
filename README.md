## Introduction

Angry Birds is a puzzle-solving game where the player uses a slingshot to launch birds at various structures that protect pigs. The goal is to knock down the structures, eliminate all the pigs, and cause as much destruction as possible to score points.

This version offers the original mechanics, bringing back the fun with birds, pigs, and physics-based puzzles. Players will control a slingshot, aim, and launch birds to hit the pigs. The game is divided into levels, with each level having unique layouts and obstacles. The game progresses as players eliminate pigs and complete challenges.
