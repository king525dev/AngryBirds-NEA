====== NEA Project ======
Created Monday 24 June 2024

Creating a Geometry Dash clone in Unity can be an exciting project! Here are some steps to get you started:

1. **Artwork and Assets**:
   - Design or find the artwork for your game elements (like the cube character, obstacles, and background).
   - Import these assets into Unity.

2. **Player Movement**:
   - Create a player object (e.g., the cube).
   - Add a rigid body component to it.
   - Write a script to handle movement (e.g., constant rightward motion) using the rigid body's velocity.

3. **Obstacles and Level Design**:
   - Place obstacles (spikes, platforms, etc.) in your level.
   - Design interesting and challenging levels.
   - Consider using a tilemap system for level creation.

4. **Physics and Collisions**:
   - Set up collision detection between the player and obstacles.
   - Use box colliders for simple shapes.

5. **Camera Movement**:
   - Create a camera that follows the player.
   - Adjust camera position based on player movement.

6. **Audio and Music**:
   - Add background music and sound effects.
   - Trigger audio events (e.g., when the player jumps or hits an obstacle).

7. **UI and Menus**:
   - Create menus (main menu, level selection, etc.).
   - Implement UI elements (score display, lives, etc.).

8. **Level Progression**:
   - Track progress (distance covered, score, etc.).
   - Implement checkpoints and respawn points.

9. **Testing and Polishing**:
   - Test your game thoroughly.
   - Fine-tune gameplay mechanics, difficulty, and controls.
   - Optimize performance.

10. **Learn from Existing Tutorials**:
	- Check out tutorials like:
